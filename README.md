# Questions

1. How much time did you ennd up spending on it?
   A. Spent little more than 6 hours, still felt incomplete and want to provide this as an mvp.

2. What are some of the design decisions you have made?
   A. Made the services more abstract so to extend it for further development. And the entire architecture to separte view-logic, business logic
   and service logic is one decision i took.

3. What do you like about your implementation?
   A. I liked how the design of services (api) has come out. Used extendable code and wrote more on abstract and interface level.

4. What would you improve next time?
   A. Couldn't spen more time on testing, would definnitely improve that. And didnt get a change to show case my experitise on global state management
   lib like redux with sagas etc.

## All said, really could have done much more if spent more time. Happy with the outcome. Looking forward for feedback. Thanks!
